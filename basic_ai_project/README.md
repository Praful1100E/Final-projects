# Basic AI Project

This is a simple AI-based project demonstrating machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. It loads the Iris dataset, trains a Decision Tree Classifier, evaluates its accuracy, and makes a prediction on a sample.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python is installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```

This will output the model's accuracy on the test set and a prediction for a sample input.

## What It Does

- Loads the Iris dataset (a classic ML dataset with flower measurements).
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluates accuracy.
- Predicts the class of a sample flower based on its features.
